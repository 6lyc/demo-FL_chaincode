# A demo of Federated Learning ChainCode
Based on the Fabric framework and golang, we implement a smart contract for a variety of federated learning algorithms to further promote the development of decentralized federated learning (i.e. blockchain-based federated learning).
## Setup
    Hyperledger Fabric
